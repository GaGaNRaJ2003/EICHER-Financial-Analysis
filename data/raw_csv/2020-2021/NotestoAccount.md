The Company has considered the possible effects that may result from the global health pandemic relating to COVID-19 on its operations. Management believes that it has taken into account external and internal information for assessing the possible impact of COVID-19 on various elements of its financial results, including its liquidity position and the recoverability of assets. However, the impact assessment of COVID-19 is a continuing process, given the uncertainties associated with its nature and duration. The Company will continue to monitor any material changes to future economic conditions and the consequent impact on its business, if any.

The above results have been reviewed and recommended by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors in their meetings held on May 27, 2021 and were subjected to an audit by the statutory auditors.

The figures for the previous periods have been reclassified/regrouped, wherever necessary.
